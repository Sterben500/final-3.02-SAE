# Installation process

These procedures are really important to go step by step. Do not skip to another part or else the project won't work.

Requirements 

- Python3
- Pyqt5
- Pandas
    
This command would install the requirements on most machines for sure.

    apt install python3 
    pip install Pyqt5
    pip install pandas 

/Launching the Server

    python3 main_window.py

/Launching the Client

    python3 client.py

I haven't tested this on a Mac OSX machine. I don't have any Mac, but I'm confident that the command above should work. It's a Linux-based system, so it should be somewhat compatible with other Linux systems.

1. The first step would be to press the connect button once a green button would appear this mean that the server started and is awaiting an import

2. Launch the [client.py](http://client.py) on a local machine

3. Import the [test.](http://test.py)json thatâ€™s been modified to the [server.py](http://server.py) 

4. On the server, select the client you wish to connect to. Once selected, it is already connected; no need to press "connect" again.

You are able to send commands such as os , ip , users , help, clear , quit

For the moment, the public connection between client and server is available only if you port forward. I've tried it, and it does work. Testing on a local machine will work, too you won't need any port forwarding.
